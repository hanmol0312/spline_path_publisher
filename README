# trajectory_tracking_nav2

## 1. Introduction

This Repository Generates a Catmullâ€“Rom Spline Path with the given points. 

## 2. Clone the repository.

```
mkdir my_ws
cd my_ws
mkdir src
cd src


```

## 3. Build the project.

```
cd ..
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## 4. Launch the rviz

```
rviz2
ros2 run spline_generator catmull_rom_node

```


## 5. The following is the spline path generated.

![Trajectory as saved for that particular duration.](attachment:6e503e75-868d-40ca-8c17-70aa647ae11d:Screenshot_from_2025-03-01_10-32-08.png)

Trajectory as saved for that particular duration.

## 6. Approach

- The resolution is 0.1 so all the path generated through the formula is discretized in the loop considering points at distance of 0.1 and thereby generating the path.
